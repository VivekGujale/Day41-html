            <h3>Understanding Small-Cap Stocks</h3>
            <p>Small-cap stocks are shares of companies with total market capitalization in the range of
                about $300 million to $2 billion. Small-cap companies have the
                potential for high rates of growth, making them appealing investments,
                though their stocks may experience more volatility and pose higher risks to investors.</p>

            <h3>Understanding Mid-Cap Stocks</h3>
            <p>Mid-cap companies are companies whose market cap is above Rs 5,000 crore but less than Rs 20,000 crore.
                Investing in these companies can be riskier than investing in large-cap market companies.
                This is because mid-caps tend to be more volatile. On the other hand, mid-cap companies also
                have the ability to turn into large-cap companies in the long run. These companies offer a higher
                growth potential than do large-cap stocks, and hence more investors are attracted to investing in such
                companies.</p>

            <h3>Understanding Large-Cap Stocks</h3>
            <p>Large-cap stocks are trendy investment choices. These are shares from companies with a market
                capitalisation
                of more than Rs 20,000 crore. Large companies are financially stable and can handle economic crises
                better.
                But before investors buy these shares, they must grasp large-cap meaning, features, and drawbacks.
                idea-sharing. Many large-cap stocks pay regular dividends and are suitable for investors looking for
                passive income.</p>

            <h3>Understanding IPO Stocks</h3>
            <p>When a private company first sells shares of stock to the public, this process is known as an initial
                public offering (IPO).
                In essence, an IPO means that a company's ownership is transitioning from private ownership to public
                ownership. For that reason,
                the IPO process is sometimes referred to as "going public."</p>

            <h3>Understanding Penny Stocks</h3>
            <p>A penny stock refers to a small company's stock that typically trades for less than $5 per share.
                Although some penny stocks trade on large exchanges such as the NYSE, most penny stocks trade over
                the counter through the OTC Bulletin Board (OTCBB). While there can be sizable gains in trading penny
                stocks,
                there are also equal risks of losing a significant amount of an investment in a short period.

            <h3>Understanding Dividend Stocks</h3>
            <p>A dividend can be described as a reward that publicly-listed companies extend to their shareholders,
                and its source is the companyâ€™s net profit. Such rewards can either be in the form of cash, cash
                equivalent,
                shares, etc. and are mostly paid from the remaining share of profit once essential expenses are met.</p>
